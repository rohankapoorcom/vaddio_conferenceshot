The Vaddio Conferenceshot integration allows for the control of a Vaddio Conferenceshot, Conferenceshot AV, or Clearshot camera with Home Assistant.

These cameras expose a telnet interface for getting their status as well as controlling them. This integration adds support for a very limited set of commands at this point. More can be added if there is a desire/request for them.

Pull requests are welcome.
